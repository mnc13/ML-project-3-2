## From Pixels to Prognosis: Machine Learning based Pneumonia Analysis

Pneumonia, a leading cause of global morbidity
 and mortality, presents a diagnostic challenge due to its varied
 etiologies and overlapping clinical symptoms. This paper inves
tigates a hybrid deep learning approach for automated pneu
monia classification using chest X-ray images, combining pre
trained DenseNet-121 and Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Both
 backbones are frozen, and only the classifier heads are trained
 on a multiclass dataset of 9,208 chest X-ray images comprising
 four classes: Normal, COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral
 Pneumonia. A 5-fold cross-validation strategy ensures robust
 and generalizable performance. The hybrid model demonstrates
 strong capability in distinguishing between these classes, achiev
ing high classification accuracy. Model interpretability is assessed
 using techniques such as Grad-CAM, providing insights into
 decision-making. These findings underscore the potential of the
 hybrid approach as an objective, efficient, and timely diagnostic
 aid, particularly in resource-limited clinical settings.
