# ML-project-3-2

Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is frequently misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s Disease (PD), leading to delayed treatments and poor outcomes. This project pioneers a Multimodal Machine Learning-Based framework that combines MRI-based midbrain structural analysis (detecting PSP’s "hummingbird sign") with speech pattern profiling (PD-specific dysarthria) to reduce diagnostic errors addressing a critical gap in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.The model will leverage the PD and PSP datasets, with speech data augmented from Parkinson’s voice repositories.
